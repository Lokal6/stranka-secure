# Caption Functionality Removal

This document describes the changes made to remove the caption functionality from the project.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed caption-related files:**
   - Deleted `caption-proxy.js`
   - Deleted `CAPTION_DEPLOYMENT.md`

2. **Modified code in index.html:**
   - Removed `cc_load_policy=1` parameter from all YouTube embed URLs
   - Set `cc_load_policy` to 0 in the player options to explicitly disable captions
   - Hidden the captions toggle button and captions container in the UI
   - Disabled all caption-related functions:
     - `fetchCaptions`
     - `displayCaptions`
     - `setupCaptionTracking`
     - `setupIntervalBasedCaptionTracking`
     - `addCaptionIfNew`
     - `isNavigationText`
     - Disabled calls to `updateActiveCaptions`

## Manual Steps Required

The `yt-caption-fetcher` directory could not be automatically deleted because some files are being used by another process. Please manually delete this directory when you close all applications:

```
rmdir /s /q allin\yt-caption-fetcher
```

## Verification

After making these changes, the YouTube videos should play without displaying captions by default. Users can still manually enable captions through the YouTube player controls if they want to, but they won't be displayed by default.
